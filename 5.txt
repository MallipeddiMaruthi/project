My thoughts for a  design document on how to crawl a website site and save the images and text from the website.
1.Image Cyborg is a web app that quickly downloads all the images of a web page. This Handy tool has a simple and straightforward home interface just like a searching engine. You have nowhere to go except download the images.
  Despite the easy accessibility, it comes with some apparent defects. Here are my using experiences.
  1. Images are mostly low resolution and small sized. Yes, most of them are thumbnail images.
  2. The zip files share the same name: [image-cyborg]. Need to rename the file one by one.
  3. Some logos or avatars images will be packed but you might need them.
